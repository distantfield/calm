# Calm

**Calm** is a collection of functions we wrote to make developing on Google AppScript an ever so slightly more calming experience. 

This repository provides reusable functions for simple tasks such as JSON, text and URL handling. 


# Using Calm 

Calm may be used in two ways: 

* Self-hosted in your account.
* As a hosted library via Distant Field Labs. 

## Self-Hosted Instances 

For security and reliability reasons, we always recommend  deploying and maintaining your own version of any third-party libraries in your Google Workspace account and Calm is no different. 

To conduct your own deployment, either create a new [script project](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/projects) within your account. 

Once deployed, you can either copy and paste each of the files in Utils/ to your project or, leverage [clasp](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp) to deploy. 

## Hosted Library

If you are in a hurry, or in a position where you cannot host your own version of Calm, in the Library section of your project add the following Script ID: 

`1fpRT-3azh7Dd-cX-XATuS0Puv2RVi4-AuIbN2mgtTlEboi49zgmT9_P-`
