# Calm

**Calm** is a collection of functions we wrote to make developing on Google AppScript an ever so sl∆íightly more calming experience. 

This repository provides reusable functions for simple tasks such as JSON, text and URL handling. 


# Using Calm 

For security and reliability reasons, we do not offer Calm as a hoted library. 

To conduct your own deployment, either create a new [script project](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/projects) within your account. 

Once deployed, you can either copy and paste each of the files in Utils/ to your project or, leverage [clasp](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp) to deploy.
